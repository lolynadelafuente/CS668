The order to run the code is as follows:
1. accesingdata
- For this you must create an account in [SourceCooperative](https://source.coop/repositories/nasa/tropical-storm-competition/access) and create both your API ACCESS and API SECRET ACCESS KEY.
- After doing this, you must replace your keys under the spaces corresponding to them under the `setting up authentication and endpoint` part of the code.
- Run the script and wait till the entire repository is downloaded under your current working directory (will take a few days).

2. benchmark
- This Python Notebook contains a small EDA part, followed by the whole process stated in the [Benchmark Solution Tutorial by DrivenDataLabs](https://drivendata.co/blog/predict-wind-speeds-benchmark/)
- To ensure you have everything working locally and to start training and evaluating a pretrained CNN you should run it.
- Disclaimer: This notebook is not a literal copy of the code in said article but follows the same order with some major adjustments in functions and extra code for better comprehension.
