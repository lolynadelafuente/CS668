Lolyna de la Fuente Ordaz

* *This work was realized as part of the capstone project of the MS in Data Science at Pace University.*
* **Abstract:** Abstract of the project (to be completed at the end of the semester).
* **Dataset:**
   * The training data consists of single-band satellite images from 494 different storms from 2000 to 2019 in the Atlantic and East Pacific Oceans, prepared by the NASA IMPACT team and Radiant Earth Foundation.
   * The train set consists of  70,257 images and the test set consists of 44,377 images.
   * Each image is 366x366 pixels containing 4 features and 1 label.
   * The dataset is available here: [Tropical Cyclone Wind Estimation Competition](https://source.coop/repositories/nasa/tropical-storm-competition/access)
* **Methodology:** Methodology used in the project with justification (to be completed at the end of the semester)
* **Results:** Results obtained in the project with 1-2 charts / images (to be completed at the end of the semester)
* **Poster** (as an image)
