# Predicting Wind Speeds of Storms in the Atlantic and East Pacific Oceans using NASA IMPACT team and Radiant Earth Foundation satellite images

Lolyna de la Fuente Ordaz

* *This work was realized as part of the capstone project of the MS in Data Science at Pace University.*
* **Abstract:** Tropical cyclones are one of the costliest natural disasters globally. Determining an accurate tropical cyclone intensity helps better initialization in forecast models, leading to more accurate forecasts, more accurate historical records of tropical cyclones and providing consistent intensity estimates. The goal of this project is motivated by the contribution to public safety by improving storm predictions by apply machine learning and statistical models, potentially helping communities prepare for and respond to natural disasters.

* **Dataset:**
   * The training data consists of single-band satellite images from 494 different storms from 2000 to 2019 in the Atlantic and East Pacific Oceans, prepared by the NASA IMPACT team and Radiant Earth Foundation.
   * The train set consists of  70,257 images and the test set consists of 44,377 images.
   * Each image is 366x366 pixels containing 4 features and 1 label.
   * The dataset is available here: [Tropical Cyclone Wind Estimation Competition](https://source.coop/repositories/nasa/tropical-storm-competition/access)
* **Methodology:** Methodology used in the project with justification (to be completed at the end of the semester)
* **Results:** Results obtained in the project with 1-2 charts / images (to be completed at the end of the semester)
* **Poster** (as an image)
